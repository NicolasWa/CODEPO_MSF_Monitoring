The aim of this project was to prototype a monitoring device that could be plugged on pre-existing portable routers powered by batteries.

In a nutshell, here are the key features of the project:
- Client was the NGO Doctors Without Borders ('Médecins Sans Frontières)
- Design: 9 months in Belgium
- Implementation: 1 month in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo
- Monitored data: state of charge of the batteries powering the router, GPS coordinates
- Transmission protocols used: MQTT, USSD
- Strong focus on the device's autonomy (achieved: 1 month)
